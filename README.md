# P2P Crypto Lending Frontend

A responsive and modular React frontend for the SatoshiFund peer-to-peer cryptocurrency lending platform, built as part of Coder Academy‚Äôs Advanced Applications subject (DEV1003).

---

## Overview

This application allows users to interact with a secure, blockchain-inspired crypto lending service. Users can manage wallets, request and fund loans, and view transactions ‚Äî all in real time. It integrates with a RESTful backend to provide dynamic, authenticated experiences.

### Features

- üîê Authentication: Secure login and registration with JWT.
- üëõ Wallet Management: View balances, deposit/withdraw funds, and manage wallets.
- üí∏ Loan Lifecycle: Request, browse, and fund loans.
- üîÑ Transactions: View full transaction history with type and timestamp.
- üì± Responsive Design: Fully functional on desktop, tablet and mobile.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Error Handling: Graceful, user-friendly feedback for invalid operations.
- üß™ Testing: Component-level testing with Jest and React Testing Library.

### Github
This project can be found on [GitHub at the SatoshiFund organisation repo](https://github.com/orgs/SatoshiFundAus/repositories).

### Live Frontend
The frontend is live and available for use at: [https://satoshifund.netlify.app/](https://satoshifund.netlify.app/)

## API Integration
This frontend communicates with the SatoshiFund backend via RESTful API endpoints. The backend is currently live and available at: [https://dev1003-p2p-crypto-lending-backend.onrender.com](https://dev1003-p2p-crypto-lending-backend.onrender.com)

### Current Limitations
While the system provides a complete flow from user registration through deal acceptance and transaction generation, please note the following limitations:

- Loan repayment functionality is not implemented in the current version
- Real cryptocurrency transactions are not implemented (simulated for demonstration)

### Future Plans
- Implementation of loan repayment functionality
- Addition of user hot wallet functionality and real cryptocurrency transaction support, starting with Bitcoin
- Enhanced security features, appropriate to a web3 decentralised finance platform
- Comprehensive logging
- Implementation of rate limiting

## Tech Stack

### Core Dependencies

**React (v19.1.0)**  
A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Chosen for its declarative, component-based architecture and broad industry adoption.

**React DOM (v19.1.0)**  
Enables rendering of React components into the DOM, managing efficient UI updates through virtual DOM diffing.

**React Router DOM (v7.6.0)**  
Handles client-side routing within the app, supporting dynamic nested routes and SPA navigation.

**React Toastify (v11.0.5)**  
Lightweight notification system for displaying toast messages. Used for success/error alerts throughout the app.

**@fortawesome/fontawesome-free (v6.7.2)**  
Provides scalable vector icons used across the UI to enhance visual clarity and user feedback.

### Development Dependencies

**Vite (v6.3.5)**  
Next-generation frontend build tool and dev server. Offers lightning-fast HMR, native ES modules, and faster builds compared to Webpack.

**@vitejs/plugin-react (v4.4.1)**  
Official Vite plugin that enables React Fast Refresh and JSX transformation.

**Jest (v29.7.0) & babel-jest (v30.0.0-beta.3)**  
Jest serves as the primary testing framework, with Babel support for modern JavaScript and JSX.

**@testing-library/react (v16.3.0) & @testing-library/jest-dom (v6.6.3)**  
Encourages writing tests that reflect user behavior and accessibility best practices in React components.

**ESLint (v9.25.0)**  
Linter for JavaScript used to enforce consistent code style. Configured with Airbnb-style conventions and integrated with Prettier.

**Prettier**  
Code formatter used in conjunction with ESLint to ensure readable, consistent code. Applied via IDE plugins and ESLint rules.

**Babel Presets**  
Includes `@babel/preset-env` and `@babel/preset-react` to support modern JavaScript and JSX features in the test environment.

**TypeScript Definitions**  
`@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` provide improved type safety and IDE support, even in a JavaScript-based codebase.

---

## Code Style

This project uses a custom ESLint configuration built on top of the **ESLint Recommended Rules**, along with plugins tailored for React and modern development best practices.

### Style Guide

- **Base Rules:** Built on [`@eslint/js`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-new#eslintjs) recommended rules
- **React Hooks:** Enforced with [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) to ensure correct hook usage and prevent common mistakes
- **Vite Integration:** Includes [`eslint-plugin-react-refresh`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-refresh) to prevent unsafe exports during fast refresh
- **Globals:** Browser-specific globals enabled via [`globals`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/globals)
- **Parser:** ECMAScript 2020+ with JSX support

### Key Rules Enforced

- No unused variables (`no-unused-vars`) ‚Äî ignores variables that match constants or uppercase patterns (e.g. `CAPITAL_CASE`)
- React hooks rules strictly followed (`react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`, `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`)
- Restricts export patterns that can break hot module reloads (`react-refresh/only-export-components`)

This configuration ensures consistency across the codebase, encourages safe React practices, and aligns with modern JavaScript standards.

Note: Formatting (e.g. spacing, indentation) is managed through ESLint rules and Prettier integrations in local IDEs.

## Technology Decisions and Alternatives

This frontend project builds on the architectural and design principles outlined in our [Planning & Design Documentation](docs/assignment-1/DEV1003_Assessment_01.pdf). We proposed a React + Vite stack, justified by its developer experience, speed, and alignment with modern frontend best practices.

Below is a summary comparing our chosen technologies with alternatives that were considered:

| Category             | Chosen Tool                 | Alternatives                   | Rationale                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend Framework   | React                       | Vue, Angular                   | React is widely adopted, modular, and aligned with our learning goals.   |
| Build Tool           | Vite                        | Webpack, Parcel                | Vite is faster, simpler, and offers out-of-the-box HMR and modern syntax.|
| Routing              | React Router DOM            | Reach Router                   | React Router is the standard choice for SPAs and is well-documented.     |
| Styling              | CSS Modules                 | Styled Components, Sass        | CSS Modules offer simple scoping without runtime overhead.               |
| Icons                | Font Awesome                | Material Icons, Heroicons      | Font Awesome provided consistent styling and broad icon coverage.        |
| Notifications        | react-toastify              | Notistack, Snackbar            | react-toastify is simple, flexible, and integrates easily with React.    |
| Testing Framework    | Jest + React Testing Library| Mocha + Enzyme                 | Jest + RTL encourages user-centric testing and is well-supported.        |
| Code Quality         | ESLint + Prettier           | StandardJS, XO                 | This pairing enforces modern JavaScript standards and automatic formatting. |
| Development Hosting  | Netlify                     | Vercel, GitHub Pages           | Netlify supports CI/CD, environment variables, and React routing out of the box. |

These decisions reflect a balance between performance, team familiarity, and the educational scope of the project. Where possible, we chose tools that simplified setup while encouraging best practices in component design, testing, and code quality. For full justification of our architectural and planning choices, see the linked design documentation.
